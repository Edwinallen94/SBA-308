// Employ basic JavaScript syntax accurately.
// Implement control flow structures such as conditionals and loops effectively.
// Use arrays and objects to organize and manage data.
// Develop functions to create reusable code.
// Utilize loops and iteration to navigate through data collections.
// Implement error handling to manage potential code failures gracefully.

//You will create a script that gathers data, processes it,
//and then outputs a consistent result as described by a specification.
//This is a very typical situation in industry, and this particular scenario has been modified from a real application.
//The data you will use is provided below.

//steps to start the function
// 1. Need to create a function that GATHERS Data that outputs the results
// 2. Four different data types (courseInfo, assignmentGroup, assignmentInfo and learnerSubmission)
// 3. should throw an error (try/catch??)

function dataGatherer(
  courseInfo,
  assignmentGroup,
  assignmentInfo,
  learnerSubmission
) {
  //adding each data types as parmaters
}
